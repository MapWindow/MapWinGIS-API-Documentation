/// 
/// 1. Added support for variety of vector datasources through GDAL/OGR drivers. 
///     - spatial databases (PostGIS, MS SQL, SpatialLite, etc.)
///     - commonly used vector formats (MapInfo TAB, KML, etc.);
///     - listing of layers in datasource using OgrDatasource class;
///     - adding of OGR layers on the map using OgrLayer class (AxMap.AddLayer); 
///     - SQL queries against datasource (OgrDatasource.RunQuery, OgrDatasource.ExecuteSQL);
///     - editing and saving of changes back to datasource (if particular driver supports it);
///     - saving of style information (either .mwsymb file or as a table in RDMS datasource);
///     - integration with all previously written shapefile-based client code;
/// 
/// 2. Built-in Shape Editor. Supports:
///     - creation and editing of shapes, parts and vertices (cmAddShape and cmEditShape tools);
///     - group operations on the number selected shapes (cmMoveShapes and cmRotateShapes tools);
///     - overlay operations (cmSplitByPolyline, cmSplitByPolygon, cmClipByPolygon, cmEraseByPolygon);
///     - undo/redo capability for all the operations (UndoList class);
///     - snapping to the vertices of existing shapes (ShapeEditor.SnapBehavior);
///     - dynamic display of area, length of segments and their bearing;
///     - user events (AxMap.BeforeShapeEdit, AxMap.ValidateShape, AxMap.ValidationFailed, AxMap.AfterShapeEdit);
///     - ShapeEditor class to control various settings (available via AxMap.ShapeEditor);
/// 
/// 3. .NET Demo application which demonstrates the usage of the latest API:
///     - opening of shapefiles, rasters and OGR vector layers (PostGIS layer and diskbased formats);
///     - complete Shape Editor;
///     - TMS tiles from the range of servers;
///     - geolocation dialog.
/// 
/// 4. Improved selection tool:
///     - selection can be done automatically now (no need to handle SelectBoxFinal event );
///     - a layer to select from can be specified by handling AxMap.ChooseLayer event;
///     - nicer rendering of selection rectangle;
///     - new cmSelectByPolygon tool;
/// 
/// 5. New tool to display shapefile attributes (cmIdentify ):
///     - can highlight shapes under mouse cursor during mouse move operations (fires ShapeHightlighted event);
///     - fires ShapeIdentified event, which can be handled by client code to display attributes;
///     - works either for a selected layer or all layers at once (Identifier.tkIdentifierMode);
/// 
/// 6. Improved API to handle projection mismatch for layers:
///     - AxMap events: LayerProjectionIsEmpty, ProjectionMismatch, LayerReprojected;
///     - GlobalSettings properties: AllowLayersWithoutProjection, AllowProjectionMismatch, ReprojectLayersOnAdding;
///     - decision about adding/rejecting layers can be taken on per-layer basis by handling events;
/// 
/// 7. Improved error reporting:
///     - GlobalSettings.ApplicationCallback property (serves as callback each and every COM class);
///     - reporting of GDAL errors meesages through the application callback;

///     - Yahoo maps and Topomapper providers were removed (services were discontinued);
///     - Yandex maps providers were removed (license limitations);
/// 
/// \section changes492 Changes in version 4.9.2.
/// 
/// 1. New zoom bar (AxMap.ShowZoomBar):
///     - displayed when map has a projection; 
///     - depends upon selected tile provider.
/// 
/// 2. Enhanced handling of online tiles:
///     - animation for zooming and panning operations (AxMap.AnimationOnZooming, AxMap.InertiaOnPanning);
///     - in native projection mode snapping to the closest zoom level on all changes of extents;
///     - no scaling in native projection (tile size will be exactly 256 by 256 pixels) and adjustment 
/// as close as possible to original size in non-native projection;
///     - correct rendering of GMercator tiles in WGS84 projection (extrapolation outside world extents);
///     - no duplicate HTTP requests, reduced number of cache searches;
///     - reduced number of available zoom levels when server and map projections don't match to avoid 
/// distortions (GlobalSettings.TilesMinZoomOnProjectionMismatch);
/// 
/// 3. Built-in GDAL overview creation and recognition for grid datasources:
///     - GDAL overviews creation and usage will be chosen as preferable option
/// over creation of proxy image;
///     - proxy images will be used only if they were already created 
/// or if their creation is requested explicitly;
///     - the number of overviews is chosen automatically (GlobalSettings.MinOverviewWidth);
///     - overviews are stored in external .ovr file for original grids and as built-in
/// data for TIFF proxy images;
///     - compression can be specified for TIFF proxy images (GlobalSettings.TiffCompression).
/// 
/// 4. Built-in projection mismatch behaviours (AxMap.ProjectionMismatchBehavior):
///     - affects AxMap.AddLayer and AxMap.AddLayerFromFilename;
///     - if datasource projection doesn't match map projection layer adding operation can be cancelled;
///     - reprojection on the fly is available as an option for shapefiles;
///     - default behaviour is pmbIgnore which is the same as behaviour in previous versions.
/// \note Substituted with another set of API members in version 4.9.3.
/// 
/// 5. New polygon coloring algorithm, which works on assumptions defined in 
/// <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">Four color theorem</a>,
/// but uses fast heuristic which can employ somewhat more colors than optimal solution
/// (ShapefileCategories.GeneratePolygonColors).
/// 
/// 6. New <a href="https://hot.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap Humanitarian</a> tile provider.
/// 
/// \section changes491 Changes in version 4.9.1.

///     - updated API to handle proxy images for grid visualization (Grid.HasValidImageProxy, Grid.CreateImageProxy, etc.)
///     - writing/reading of grid color scheme to/from XML file (GridColorScheme.ReadFromFile, GridColorScheme.WriteToFile);
///     - double overloads for I/O operations: Grid.GetRow2 / Grid.PutRow2, Grid.GetFloatWindow2 / Grid.PutFloatWindow2.
/// 
/// 2. New FileManager class:
///     - encapsulates possible opening strategies of %Image and %Grid datasources, reducing the routine coding needed;
///     - AxMap.AddLayerFromFilename to add data to map with a single line of code by using built AxMap.FileManager instance.
/// 
/// 3. Measuring tool:
///     - available as cmMeasure cursor for AxMap.MapCursor property;
///     - measuring of distance along polyline or area of polygon received from user mouse input;
///     - precise calculations on ellipsoid are performed by <a href="http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/html/">GeograpicLib</a> if projection for the map is set.
/// 
/// 4. Enhanced scalebar & coordinates display:
///     - 3 scalebar modes including Google styled mode and nicer rendering (AxMap.ScalebarUnits);
///     - scalebar will perform precise calculation on ellipsoid if projection for map is specified;
///     - display of coordinates under mouse cursor (AxMap.ShowCoordinates).
/// 
/// 5. New properties to initialize map control from .NET form designer:
///     - AxMap.Projection, AxMap.CurrentZoom, AxMap.TileProvider, AxMap.Latitude, AxMap.Longitude;

///     - "*" - zoom to the closest tile level;
///     - "Home" = zoom to combined extents of all data layers (max extents);
///     - "Backspace" = zoom to previous extents; 
///     - "Shift + Left", "Shift + Right" - zoom to the prev/ next layer;
///     - "Z" = ZoomIn tool; 
///     - "M" = measuring tool; 
///     - "Space" = switches to panning mode; after releasing space the previous map cursor is restored.
/// 
/// 7. New functionality to initialize map projection from data layers:
///     - AxMap.GrabProjectionFromData property;
///     - when it is on, projection will also be removed on removal of the last layer from map.
/// 
/// 8. Support of discrete zoom levels defined by tiles providers:
///     - AxMap.ZoomToTileLevel method;
///     - AxMap.ZoomBehavior = zbUseZoomLevels behavior;

///     - filenames are passed to GDAL methods and are serialized to XML as UTF-8 strings.
/// 
/// 12. New API members in GeoProjection class:
///     - GeoProjection.TryAutoDetectEpsg (OGRSpatialReference implementation);
///     - GeoProjection.IsFrozen (to protect AxMap.GeoProjection from changing).
/// 
/// 13. %Shapefile validation:
///     - shapefiles passed as input and output of geoprocessing methods are checked for invalid shapes;
