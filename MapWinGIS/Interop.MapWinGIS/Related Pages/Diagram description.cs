/// \section one I. Pseudo class diagram.
/// This diagram represents "contains" type of the relation between 2 classes, i.e. when an instance of the class
/// holds some of instances of the other classes and expose access to them through certain properties. For example
/// an instance of Shapefile class may hold several instance of Shape class (1 to 0..n relation), an instance of 
/// Shape class in the same manner may hold points. \n\n
/// The diagrams are interactive. After the click on the rectangle
/// the description of corresponding class will be shown, after the click on the arrow - a property which extracts
/// instances of nested class. These diagrams has nothing to do with the inheritance.
