/// \page documentation How to document further
/// 
/// Here is a brief overview of documentation project, doxygen tags and diagrams specification which were used to create this documentation. \n
/// 
/// \section solution I. Documentation solution and files. 
/// The documentation is built not for the MapWinGIS source but for C# interop assemblies. It's possible to provide more friendly C# syntax in such 
/// way (rather then C++) and use the same solution to generate Visual Studio Intellisense file.\n\n
/// The solution consists of 3 projects:
/// - Interop.MapWinGIS (holds definitions of COM interfaces);
/// - AxInterop.MapWinGIS (holds definition of AxMap control);
/// - Examples (the files with C# examples and small WinForms application to test them).
/// .
/// The following switch is used to provide the desired names for documentation and Intellisense file.
/// \code
/// #if nsp
///     namespace MapWinGIS {
/// #endif
/// #if nsp
///     public class IShapefile
/// #else
///     public class Shapefile
/// #endif
/// \endcode
/// For documentation we shall get %Shapefile, for Intellisense - MapWinGIS.IShapefile (nsp is defined in Project Build symbols) \n\n
/// The Doxygen setings are stored in the <b>"MapWinGIS doxyfile"</b> file in the root folder of the solution. Also there are several files 
/// that override default style settings: DoxygenLayout.xml, header.html, doxygen.css.
/// 
/// \section new_members II. How to add new members.
/// To add the new members to the documentation after they were added to MapWinGIS it's necessary:\n\n
/// <b>1.</b> Rebuild Interop assemblies;\n
/// <b>2.</b> Add new members to the appropriate interface. \n\n
/// The most convenient way is to change the following line:
/// \code public class IShapefile // or any other interface \endcode
/// to the line: 
/// \code public class Shapefile: MapWinGIS.IShapefile \endcode
/// Then to choose "Implement interface IShapefile" from the smart tag and to revert the changes back.\n\n
/// <b>3.</b> Add C# documentation comments and doxygen tags. \n
/// <b>4.</b> Generate the new html documentation by Doxygen. 
/// 
/// To run Doxygen generation process:
/// - run Doxywizard.exe;
/// - open the file "MapWinGIS doxyfile" in the root folder of the solution;
/// - click "Run doxygen" button on the "Run" tab.
/// .
/// The new documentation will be placed into "ouput" folder inside solution.
/// 
/// \section examples III. New Examples. 
/// Some guidelines on how to add a new example on the <a href = "Examples.html">Examples page.</a>\n\n
/// 1. Each new example must be placed in separate .cs file in "Examples\src" folder or its subfolders.\n\n
/// 2. The file must add some public function to MapExamples partial class.\n\n
/// 3. It should be registered in the application (see "Examples\Description.cs").\n\n
/// 4. A file "examples_list.cs" with necessary definitions will be automatically generated in "Interop.MapWinGIS\Related pages\" 
/// folder on the running of the project.\n\n
/// 5. It's possible to create a screenshot with the results of the example by clicking Snapshot button in the application.
/// The screenshot will be added to the documentation automatically.
/// 
/// \section doxygen_tags IV. Doxygen tags.
/// All the tags must be placed as C# comments (3 slashes) before the declaration of the member. The declaration of the 
/// <a href="pages.html">Related pages</a> and <a href = "examples.html">Examples</a> can be placed in any part of the .cs files.\n\n
/// Here is list of useful Doxygen tags:
/// \include doxygen_tags.txt
/// <a href = "http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual.html">Doxygen manual</a>\n\n
/// The path for external files (the files should be placed in either that or any nested folder): 
/// \code
/// Resources\graphs\
/// Resources\images\
/// Examples\src\
/// \endcode
/// Doxygen will automatically place links for the API members in case their full name is typed: AxMap. Use "%" sign 
/// to prevent this behavior: %AxMap \n\n
/// Cross references in the examples are placed automatically as well. The only precondition - the correct declaration of 
/// variable type (either local or parameter). MapWinGIS namespace must not be used, i.e. Shapefile but not MapWinGIS.Shapefile.\n
/// 
/// \section dot_tags V. Graphs definition.
/// Graphs a generated using <a href = "http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/diagrams.html">Graphviz tool</a>.\n\n
/// They can be either:
/// - inlined in code between \htmlonly\dot \enddot\endhtmlonly commands;
/// - defined in external file.
/// . 
///
/// Graph definition consists of several parts:
/// - general settings;
/// - node settings;
/// - list of nodes;
/// - edges settings;
/// - list of edges.
/// .
/// The settings for nodes and edges can be:
/// - global (node and edge tags) which are used for all the following lines;
/// - local which are used for a single node or edge and override global settings.
/// .
/// Here is a small example to give the general idea about the structure. See details
/// in the description of Dot tool in Graphviz documentation.
/// \include dot_tags.txt
/// 
/// The output will be the following:
/// \dotfile dot_tags.txt
///
